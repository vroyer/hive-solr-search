Introduction
============

Apache SOLR is a power full search engine. With this Hive SOLR Search Storage Handler, you can combine SOLR search with Hive QL to achieve powerfull analytics. 

If you are you using Datastax Entreprise, Cassandra tables can be indexed by SOLR (see http://www.datastax.com/documentation/datastax_enterprise/4.5/datastax_enterprise/srch/srchIntro.html) and a SOLR search should be much faster than a MapReduce job.  


Installation
============

To install:

	$ git clone http://github.org/SteppeChange/hive-solr-search
	$ cd hive-solr-search
	$ mvn package
	$ cp target/hive-solr-search-0.2-cdh5.7.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar `$HIVE_HOME/lib`
	$ cp target/hive-solr-search-0.2-cdh5.7.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar `$HADOOP_HOME/lib`

Basic Usage
===========

The following examples rely on a slightly modified version of the Datastax SOLR demo using Wikipedia as an example of Solr capabilities (see http://www.datastax.com/documentation/datastax_enterprise/4.5/datastax_enterprise/srch/srchDemoSolr.html). The date field has been modified from type text to timestamp.

Create an external hive table, map SOLR document fields to columns and provide a search query string.

	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hive_solr_wiki ( id INT, date TIMESTAMP, title  STRING, name STRING) 
	STORED BY "org.vroyer.hive.solr.SolrStorageHandler" 
	WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( "solr.document.mapping" = "id,date,title,name")
	TBLPROPERTIES ("zk.url" = "http://localhost:2181/solr", "solr.qs"="q=title:%22List of solar%22" );

	hive> SELECT * FROM hive_solr_wiki;

SOLR Faceting
=============

You can also use a SOLR facets to aggregate some data like a GROUP BY, here in a range facet on a date field.

	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hive_solr_facet_search ( date TIMESTAMP, count BIGINT)
	STORED BY "org.vroyer.hive.solr.SolrStorageHandler"
	WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( "solr.facet.mapping" = "ranges")
	TBLPROPERTIES (
	   "zk.url" = "http://localhost:2181/solr",
	   "solr.qs"="q=*%3A*&facet=true&facet.range=date&facet.range.gap=%2B1YEAR&f.date.facet.range.start=NOW/YEAR%2D10YEARS&f.date.facet.range.end=NOW"
	);
	
	
	hive> SELECT * FROM hive_solr_facet_search;
	OK
	2004-01-01 00:59:59.998	0
	2005-01-01 00:59:59.998	0
	2006-01-01 00:59:59.998	0
	2007-01-01 00:59:59.998	0
	2008-01-01 00:59:59.998	0

	2010-01-01 00:59:59.998	551
	2011-01-01 00:59:59.998	2834
	2012-01-01 00:59:59.998	0
	2013-01-01 00:59:59.998	0
	Time taken: 0.704 seconds, Fetched: 10 row(s)
	
You could get the same result with the following Hive query.

	hive>SELECT year(date), count(*) FROM solr GROUP BY year(date);
	Total MapReduce jobs = 1
	Launching Job 1 out of 1
	Number of reduce tasks not specified. Estimated from input data size: 1
	Starting Job = job_201410251754_0010, Tracking URL = http://localhost:50030/jobdetails.jsp?jobid=job_201410251754_0010
	Kill Command = /Application/dse-4.5.2/bin/dse hadoop job  -kill job_201410251754_0010
	Hadoop job information for Stage-1: number of mappers: 2; number of reducers: 1

	Ended Job = job_201410251754_0010

The solr.split.size property (default is 100 000) limits the number of results updated or fetched in a SOLR request. 

Pushdown filtering
==================

If you set hive.optimize.ppd=true, the SolrStorageHandler parses the WHERE clause to build a SOLR filter query expression (fq parameter). For example, the following query generates a SOLR request with fq=title:"List of solar".

	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hive_solr_wiki_fq ( id INT, date TIMESTAMP, title  STRING) 
	STORED BY "org.vroyer.hive.solr.SolrStorageHandler" WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( "solr.document.mapping" = "id,date,title")
	TBLPROPERTIES ("zk.url" = "http://localhost:8983/solr" );
	
	hive> SELECT * FROM hive_solr_wiki_fq WHERE title='"List of solar"';
	OK

You can also use a solr_query parameter to dynamically set the SOLR q parameter, in the same way Datastax supports the solr_query parameter in a CQL statement, see http://www.datastax.com/documentation/datastax_enterprise/4.5/datastax_enterprise/srch/srchCql.html. 

	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hive_solr_wiki_q ( id INT, date TIMESTAMP, title  STRING, solr_query STRING) 
	STORED BY "org.vroyer.hive.solr.SolrStorageHandler" WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( "solr.document.mapping" = "id,date,title,solr_query")
	TBLPROPERTIES ("zk.url" = "http://localhost:2181/solr" );
	
	hive> SELECT * FROM hive_solr_wiki_q WHERE solr_query='title:natio*';
	OK

Because Hive currently evaluates the pushed predicates twice when residual predicate is null, previous examples have been tested with the patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-9186. Without this patch, the workaround is to add a fake (1=1) predicate to the where clause, but this may add a performance penalty if you don't have any filter task following the request to the SolrStorageHandler. You can check the execution...

Kerberos
================

In order to use Kerberos capabilities you have to set the following table properties: `kerberos.use, kerberos.jaas.config.path, kerberos.krb5.config.path, kerberos.useSubjectCredsOnly`.

Example:

    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hive_solr_wiki ( id INT, date TIMESTAMP, title  STRING, name STRING) 
	STORED BY "org.vroyer.hive.solr.SolrStorageHandler" 
	WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
	    "solr.document.mapping" = "id,date,title,name"
	) TBLPROPERTIES (
	    "zk.url" = "http://localhost:2181/solr",
	    "kerberos.use" = "true",
	    "kerberos.jaas.config.path" = "/tmp/jaas.conf",
	    "kerberos.krb5.config.path" = "/etc/kerberos/user.keytab",
	    "kerberos.useSubjectCredsOnly" = "true"
	);
